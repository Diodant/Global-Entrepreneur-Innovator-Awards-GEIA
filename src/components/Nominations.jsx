      <p><strong>Disqualifying Factors (Disqualifiers):</strong></p>
      <ul className="wp-block-list">
        <li>Absence of Evidence of Real Implementation: The innovation exists only at the level of concept, prototype, or internal experiment without measurable effect in real conditions.</li>
        <li>Absence of Measurable Effect Metrics: The claimed advantages are not supported by quantitative data or comparisons.</li>
        <li>Candidate&apos;s Contribution Not Documented: It is impossible to establish a direct and substantial link between the candidate&apos;s actions and the creation/implementation of the innovation. Authorship or key role is disputed or not reflected in primary documents.</li>

      <p className="nom_title">Standards of Evidentiary Basis and Evaluation Methodology</p>

      <p>The GEIA Award is conferred based on strict standards of evidentiary basis, which ensure objectivity, transparency, and compliance with international criteria for recognizing outstanding achievements. These standards are developed to verify statements corresponding to the requirements of immigration visa categories for individuals of exceptional ability.</p>

      <p><strong>Principles for Evaluating Evidence:</strong></p>

      <p><strong>Principle of Verifiability:</strong> Every substantial claim about the candidate&apos;s role, achievements, scale of influence, implementation, or recognition must be confirmed by a primary document or an authoritative independent source. Abstract descriptions without documentary support are not considered.</p>

      <p><strong>Priority of Independent (Third-Party) Confirmations:</strong> The highest evidentiary value is given to materials originating from independent and authoritative parties not subordinate to or directly dependent on the candidate. These include:</p>
      <ul className="wp-block-list">
        <li>Publications in recognized international or national business and industry media.</li>
        <li>Recommendation letters from leading industry experts, executives of partner companies, or clients.</li>
        <li>Reports from analytical agencies (Gartner, Forrester, McKinsey).</li>
        <li>Documents on previously received professional awards.</li>
        <li>Patents and certificates for intellectual property.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Principle of Measurability and Date-Bound Nature:</strong> All presented results must be expressed in quantitative, auditable indicators (financial metrics, market share growth, implementation volumes). Data must contain clear time periods, and preference is given to a clear comparison of the state &quot;before&quot; and &quot;after&quot; the implementation of projects under the candidate&apos;s leadership.</p>

      <p><strong>Proof of Key Role (Critical Role):</strong> The candidate is obliged to prove a direct cause-and-effect relationship between their specific decisions, managerial actions, or authorial contribution and the achieved exceptional results. Documents confirming authority and testimonies from independent parties detailing the personal contribution are required.</p>

      <p><strong>Confidentiality and Completeness:</strong> Candidates are permitted to conceal commercially sensitive details (exact contract amounts, specific tariffs) provided that the fact of achievement, its scale, and significance remain fully provable. The presented data from different sources (financial reports, contracts, publications) must be internally consistent.</p>

      <p><strong>Selection Methodology and Evaluation Procedure:</strong> Evaluation is conducted in several stages to ensure maximum impartiality and compliance with the stated criteria.</p>

      <p><strong>Formal Verification:</strong> The Award Secretariat checks the completeness of documents, internal consistency of data, and the presence of the minimum required evidence package. At this stage, additional clarifications may be requested.</p>

      <p><strong>Expert Evaluation Based on Standardized Criteria:</strong> Each admitted application is evaluated independently by several members of the International Jury according to an approved scale (0-100 points) within a specific nomination. Evaluation focuses exclusively on:</p>
      <ul className="wp-block-list">
        <li>Role and Contribution (Critical Role): Proven decisive role of the candidate.</li>
        <li>Measurable Results: Confirmed quantitative and qualitative achievements.</li>
        <li>Scale and Influence: Impact on the company, industry, and international activity.</li>
        <li>Innovativeness / Originality: Presence of a unique contribution.</li>
        <li>Independent Recognition (Third-Party Evidence): Confirmations from authoritative external sources.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Confidentiality and Quality Control:</strong> To eliminate bias, a system of confidential review is used. The final score for each application is formed by aggregating and analyzing the independent scores of several judges. No single jury member has the authority to unilaterally determine the result.</p>

      <p className="nom_title">Determination of Winners:</p>

      <p><strong>Shortlist:</strong> Formed from candidates who have scored the highest points, which typically corresponds to the top 15% of all participants in the season.</p>

      <p><strong>Award Winners:</strong> Determined from among the shortlisted finalists, representing the top 1% of participants, whose achievements were recognized by the jury as exceptional across all criteria. In some nominations, additional online interviews may be conducted with finalists for final confirmation of facts and details of contribution.</p>

      <p><strong>Consequences of Providing Inaccurate Information:</strong> Any signs of document forgery, data manipulation, plagiarism, or deliberate deception lead to immediate disqualification of the application at any stage of the competition.</p>
