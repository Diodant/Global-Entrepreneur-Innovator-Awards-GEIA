        <p><strong>Procedure for Forming and Working Principles of the International Jury GEIA</strong></p>
        <p>
          The International Jury of the Global Entrepreneur &amp; Innovator Awards
          (GEIA) is formed in accordance with a multi-step procedure designed to
          guarantee the highest professional authority, impartiality, and
          compliance with the standards of objective evaluation required when
          reviewing outstanding achievement statements.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Stages of Jury Formation:</strong></p>
        <p>
          9.1. Preliminary List Formation (Long List): The Secretariat of GEIA
          forms an extended list of potential judges based on their recognized
          international authority in entrepreneurship, venture investments,
          management, technology, and academic research.
        </p>
        <p>
          9.2. Reputation and Expertise Check: Candidates undergo thorough
          checks of their professional biography, public achievements, and
          expert recognition. Preference is given to individuals whose
          contribution to industry development is documented and recognized
          internationally.
        </p>
        <p>
          9.3. Competency Evaluation and Composition Balance: The final
          composition of the jury is balanced according to key parameters:
          geographical representation (to ensure a global perspective), industry
          expertise, and professional background. This eliminates the dominance
          of any single country or narrow group of interests, ensuring pluralism
          of opinions.
        </p>
        <p>
          9.4. Signing of Ethical Commitments: Each approved jury member signs a
          strict code of ethics, committing to principles of objectivity,
          confidentiality, and disclosure of any potential conflicts of interest
          related to candidates for the award.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Principles of Operation and Guarantees of Objectivity:</strong></p>
        <p>
          Disclosure of Conflicts of Interest and Self-Exclusion: Before
          evaluation begins, each jury member must disclose any potential
          business, personal, or professional connections with any of the
          candidates. If such a connection is identified, the judge immediately
          recuses themselves from evaluating that particular application, and
          this is documented by the Secretariat.
        </p>
        <p>
          Standardized Evaluation Methodology: All jury members are required to
          evaluate applications strictly within the approved methodology, using
          unified, documented criteria and scoring scales. This ensures
          comparability of decisions made by different experts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Collegiality and Multiple Checks: Each application is evaluated by
          several jury members independently. The final decision is the result
          of aggregating these independent evaluations, which eliminates the
          influence of any one person’s subjective opinion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Confidentiality of the Process: All discussions, interim evaluations,
          and personal data of candidates remain strictly confidential within
          the working group of the jury.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Confidentiality and Information Security</strong></p>
        <p>
          10.1. All application materials are confidential. Access is provided
          only to authorized individuals and appointed jury members on a
          need-to-know basis.
        </p>
        <p>
          10.2. The Secretariat ensures secure storage of materials, control
          over access, and tracking of actions with documents.
        </p>
        <p>
          10.3. Materials cannot be copied, transmitted to third parties, or
          used outside the evaluation process.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Determining Results, Shortlist, and Winners</strong></p>
        <p>
          11.1. After the evaluation, a shortlist of finalists is formed,
          usually around the top 15% of the total number of applications (the
          target for the competition cycle), depending on the number of
          applications and final distribution of points.
        </p>
        <p>
          11.2. Winners are the candidates with the highest final scores and
          confirmed compliance with the criteria, usually the top 1% (the
          target for the competition cycle), depending on the number of
          applications and final distribution of points.
        </p>
        <p>
          11.3. In some nominations, additional online interviews may be
          conducted with finalists to clarify information and verify the
          role/contribution.
        </p>
        <p><strong>11.4. Annual Summary of the Competition Cycle</strong></p>
        <p>
          11.4.1. GEIA forms an annual summary of the competition cycle,
          reflecting the aggregated results of the competition, including the
          number of submitted applications, the number of applications admitted
          for expert evaluation, the number of finalists on the shortlist, and
          the number of winners in each nomination.
        </p>
