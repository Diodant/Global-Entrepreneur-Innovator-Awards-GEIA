<p>Each new season of the award confirms its status as a platform for recognizing world-scale results. We assess those whose work has a measurable and recognized impact on the global economy, the innovation landscape, and business practices.

          <p>
            The Global Entrepreneur &amp; Innovator Awards (GEIA) was established in 2018 as a permanent and authoritative institution for
            identifying world-class achievements. Our history is one of establishing a sustainable global standard in assessing entrepreneurial
            and managerial excellence.
          </p>

          <p>
            The annual cycle of the award has allowed us to create a rigorous and objective selection methodology recognized by the international
            business community, form a jury from leading global experts, and build an elite community of winners — a global network of individuals
            whose proven achievements have already had a transformative impact on international markets.
          </p>

          <p>
            Each new season of the award confirms its status as a platform for recognizing world-scale results. We assess those whose work has a measurable
            and recognized impact on the global economy, the innovation landscape, and business practices.

          <p>
            The evaluation of the achievements of GEIA nominees is entrusted to the International Jury, formed from recognized global leaders in business
            and innovation. Each jury member undergoes a stringent multi-step selection process and meets exceptional criteria: documented outstanding
            achievements and international awards, experience in strategic leadership of global-scale companies, membership in prestigious international
            councils, and impeccable business reputation.
          </p>

          <p>
            A key requirement is absolute objectivity: all judges sign a strict code of ethics and are required to recuse themselves from evaluating candidates
            if there is any potential conflict of interest, ensuring that decisions are based solely on evidence and merit.
