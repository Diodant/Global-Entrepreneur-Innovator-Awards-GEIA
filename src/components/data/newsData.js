        "<strong>The first involves the grid.</strong> On the generation side, renewables have expanded rapidly, but grid dependence prevents fully bringing that capacity online. Our grid was designed for steady, centralized power plants, but it struggles with the intermittent, decentralised nature of modern renewables. This mismatch creates bottlenecks, forcing us to waste clean energy because it can’t get to the right place at the right time.&nbsp;",

      html:
        "We believe a big part of the solution is adding decentralised energy storage at the edge of the grid, where electricity is consumed. This bypasses bottlenecks and makes renewables reliable 24/7, elevating batteries from ‘climate tech’ to critical energy infrastructure. Based on ExxonMobil’s 2024 energy report, the world will need to scale an additional 20,000 TWh of electricity generation by 2050. To put that in perspective, that is equivalent to two-thirds of the entire world’s current output, which Ember Energy reports finally broke 30,000 TWh in 2024 after over a century. Renewables plus batteries are projected to meet 85% of that new demand. That is why we are incredibly bullish on the role of batteries over coming decades: they are the key to enabling this transition by providing cleaner energy where and when it’s needed most.&nbsp;",
    },
    {
      type: "p",
      html:
        "<strong>The second opportunity is the supply chain.</strong> Today, batteries depend on massive mining and minerals processing operations. To meet transition goals, Benchmark Minerals suggest we’d need upwards of around 400 new mines in a decade. That’s unrealistic and environmentally damaging. Compounding this, geopolitical concentration in the battery supply chain sends materials on a 50,000-mile global tour for processing and assembly, concentrating risk, cost and carbon in a product meant to be sustainable. We saw this play out with solar panels, where regional monopolies led to the deep PV dependencies today.&nbsp;&nbsp;",

      html:
        "<strong>Lyten’s approach is to remove mined minerals from the battery supply chain.</strong> Our lithium-sulphur battery removes about 85% of mined mineral content, including nickel, cobalt, manganese and graphite. We see a pathway to over 90% mining-free batteries using lithium from brines. Shifting to abundant, locally sourced materials is the way to leap batteries forward. We believe lithium-sulphur is the chemistry that will lead the way; it’s a more energy dense battery, using lower cost materials and massively diversifies and secures our battery supply chain.",

      "In this guest blog, FTI Consulting Senior Managing Directors Samuel Aguirre, Leonardo Florencio and Karthik Balisagar explore the transformative potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in the legal industry. Revealing insights from a comprehensive survey of over 100 legal practitioners worldwide, the authors explore the current landscape, challenges, and the slow adoption of AI in dispute resolution. With a focus on bridging the knowledge gap and establishing clear guidelines, they shed light on concerns, but also significant benefits AI adoption could bring.",
